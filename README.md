# Simple Tkinter Library 
This is the standalone version of the pysettings.tk package! \
The library is usable but still WIP and currently not running plain tkinter code.

It provides several features to create GUI's much simpler and faster. \
Some third party libraries, such as displaying Matplotlib graphs or using calendars, are also implemented and can be used. \
These libraries are not necessarily required to use other features.

### Why would I use this Library instead of tkinter?
* All properties of widgets can be set/changed by using tab completable methods.
* 

### Installation
Note: This library is still WIP and not registered in pip yet.

* Download Repos
* Unzip folder
* move inner tksimple (containing __init\__.py) to Python-LIB folder.
* run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install required packages. (not necessarily required)
